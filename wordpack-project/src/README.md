### Source Folder
This is where the magic happens in terms of Styles and Javascript. Here you will
create and cue your scripts. Scripts that are generated by MDEV should be placed
inside the js folder and receive appropriate names.

### Image Folder
All images should be placed in this folder, however they will be referenced
utilizing the PHP wordpress hooks for exposing the theme url as follows:

```php
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/favicon.png" />
```
